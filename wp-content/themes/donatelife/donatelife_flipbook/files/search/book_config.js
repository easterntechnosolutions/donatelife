PRESS COVERAGE - 70   ","  ABOUT DONATE LIFE    ‘What We Have Is Material, What We Do Stays Forever’    Donate Life is a non-proﬁt organisation of people who are willing to make the   world a better place to live in. We were established on December 4, 2014.    Under the leadership of Mr. Nilesh Mandlewala who has dedicated his life to this   cause since 2005 and with the support of other founder trustees, it has been our   constant endeavour to contribute to the best abilities to this noble initiative.    There are over 20lakh patients waiting for a kidney transplant in India - 2 lakh   being added to that number every year. The number for various other organs like   heart, liver, eyes are equally shocking. This worrisome situation has strengthened   our resolve to save as many lives as we can.    Till 31st December 2017, we at Donate Life have procured 234 kidney, 94 liver, 16   heart, 6 pancreas, 196 eyes and 4 bones. We have given a new lease of life to 543   people across India & the globe.    Donate Life is the pioneer for the ﬁrst ever successful cadaver heart transfer and   transplant in Western India. Donate Life is also the pioneer in ﬁrst ever inter state   heart transplant from Surat, Gujarat to Chennai, Tamil Nadu and Indore, Madhya   Pradesh.   Donate  Life  is also  responsible for carrying out  the ﬁrst-ever  bone donation,   successfully from Gujarat.    45% of the cadaveric kidney & liver transplants at Institute Of Kidney Disease &   Research Centre  in  Ahmedabad,  Gujarat,  20% of  the  heart  transplants at   Mumbai's Fortis Hospital have taken place due to the efforts of our organisation.   Also, out of the four heart transplants that have taken place at Ahmedabad's   CIMS hospital, two have been donated from Surat through Donate Life.    We are committed to spreading awareness for the importance of cadaver organ   donation. We were established for two purposes:    To spread awareness and  make cadaver donation  possible,  by  increasing  the   number of cadaver organ donations in India and facilitating the entire process.    To prevent the alarming number of kidney and liver failure cases that happen in   India and also provide them with a new lease of life.    7 ","    OUR MISSION ‘Not Everyone Has The Chance To Be God For Another; You Do’ We are as determined as soldiers are on a mission. These are our aims: To spread knowledge and awareness that aids in the prevention of kidney and liver diseases.   To spread awareness about cadaver organ donations in the country among the people.   To facilitate the process of organ donations right from procuring the organs from a donor to making sure that   the recipient gets a new lease of life.   To instill hope among the people for a new life, even after they have given up.   To convince the families of those patients who are declared brain-dead to donate organs and remove fear   from the minds of the people and encourage them to pledge their organs for donation.   To help the people cope with the mental trauma that comes when they are suffering during the diseases.   Networking with hospitals that are capable of handling organ transplantation procedure. Each and everyone of us at Donate Life contribute our time and energy without any commercial motive,   solely for the benefit of the humanity and large.   OUR VISION  ‘With Awareness Comes Knowledge, With Knowledge Comes Change’  Our prime focus has always been and will always be to serve humanity unconditionally. Our vision is to bridge the gap between the number of people who need organs and the number of people who donate organs. We want to ensure that the maximum number of people pledge their organs for donation. We also aim to make the process of organ transplantation smoother and faster. There are so many people who are declared brain dead and are beyond the scope of revival from that point. If transferred at the right time, the organs of these patients may help so many people and give them hope. Through the awareness, we spread and the counselling of the family members of such patients, we want more people to come forward and voluntarily pledge their organs for donation along with asking their families to make sure that their wish is complied with after their death. This is how we can prevent a large number of deaths - with an assurance that the organ of your loved one will live longer and provide hope to another.  We work in accordance with the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 and Transplantation of Human Organs Rules, 1995. We are also registered as a ‘Trust' under Section 80 (G) (5) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.   9 "," OUR CORE VALUES    ‘You Can Live Twice’    Selflessness   If everyone thought about the world even for a few minutes in the day, half our problems would get   solved right then. We strongly believe in selflessness, and giving it back to the society.   Social Responsibility    We know that the world does not work on it’s own. When the society as a whole takes up collective   responsibility, that is when problems get solved. We have a strong sense of social responsibility   and we strongly uphold it at every step.   Solidarity   Not everyone is born the same, not everyone is born fortunate. We don’t just express solidarity but   also act on it. We want to reduce the suffering in the world and are pro-actively working towards   our goal every day. The world needs love and care. We do our part in it.    Compassion   To be able to counsel a person who is suffering through pain, we need to be empathetic. We don’t   just understand but also feel what they are going through and then counsel them out of their   OUR TEAM   mental trauma.   Hard-working   Nothing in life comes easy. As an NGO, we face a lot of hurdles everyday and often have to race    ‘Your Actions Deﬁne You, Not Your Words’   against time in order to transfer one organ from one place to another. We work hard as the task at   our hand is to save someone’s life and not let someone’s wish to donate go in vain.    One finger alone cannot do much but five fingers together form a fist. That is the power of a  team and we strongly believe in teamwork at Donate Life.   So far, since the date of our establishment, we have been able to achieve success in carrying  out organ transfers and transplantation only because of our team of founder trustees and our  volunteers who have selflessly devoted time for this cause.   This would not have been possible without the noble Samaritans who have dedicated a lot  more than just time and energy to help humanity. 10 "," MEET DONATE LIFE’S TEAM ‘We Are Many, But One’   Mr. Nilesh Mandlewala, Founder & President   There is always one person who lays down the very first brick to build a new initiative.

It was only in the middle of the eighteenth century that the   possibility was realised.  Austrian ophthalmologist, Eduard Konrad Zirm  was an ophthalmologist who performed  the  first  successful human full-thickness corneal transplant on 7 December 1905. The donor was Karl Brauer,  an 11-year old boy who had iron metal bodies lodged in his eyes. The recipient was Alois Glogar, a   One of the major challenges that the early transplant surgeons faced was the   45-year-old day labourer whose corneas were damaged. His one eye had a clear vision after the   resistance from the immune system. The immune system is built into our body to transplant but other one had complications.   fight ‘alien' components that the body thinks to be harmful. The same happened   when an attempt at transplantation was made. Now the question faced by the India's first cornea transplant happened in 1948. Dr. RES Muthayya established the nation's first eye   doctors was that how to deal with this issue.  bank in Chennai's Regional Institute Of Ophthalmology and Government Ophthalmic Hospital. A few years later, it was discovered that some drugs could lower the body's   guard-thus the immune system. It did put the patients at risk of certain infections    but it also made transplant possible. In 1960, Dr. Peter Medawar introduced a way of typing tissue (similar to the blood   typing of the 1900s) and soon tissue typing along with immune system suppression   was used to carry out an organ transplant.The invention of an immunosuppressant   drug named ‘cyclosporine' made a major breakthrough in the 1980s. In 1986, 9000   kidney transplants were performed in the United States that a good survival rate of   85% in the first year.   KIDNEY:   On June 17, 1950, Dr. Richard Lawler, performed the first kidney transplant. 49-year-old Ruth Tucker  was the recipient and the donor was deceased. It is said that some 40 doctors watched the surgery  that took one hour to perform. Later the kidney was removed due to rejection, some 10 months later.  But those 10 months, helped Ruth survive for another 5 years on her own kidney.    Another kidney transplant was performed on December 23, 1954 in Boston by Dr. Joseph Murray. The  donor was a living one. The transplant was performed between two identical twins, Richard and  Ronald Herrick. Richard needed a kidney and Ronald's kidney matched as there was no rejection. Dr.  Murray got a noble prize for this, years later.    India's first kidney transplant was done by Dr. P.K. Sen and his team at King Edward Memorial  Hospital, Mumbai in May 1965. The recipient died 11 days later due to complications but the kidney was  working properly until death. 20  21 "," LIVER:   PANCREAS:    Dr. Thomas Starzl performed the first ever deceased donor liver transplant in 1967 on a 19-month-old The first successful pancreas transplantation in conjunction with a simultaneous kidney transplantation  Julie Rodriguez.

Organs need to be removed as soon as the   person is declared brain-dead. Without the necessary oxygen supply, the organs stop   functioning right.    The approximate amount of time between recovering the tissues/organs and transplanting   them is:    Lung - 4 to 6 hours   Heart - 4 hours   Liver - 24 hours    Pancreas - 24 hours   Kidney - 72 hours   Cornea - 14 days    Bones - 5 years   Skin - 5 year   Heart Valves - 10 years    This is why creating a tissue bank (heart valves, skin, bones etc.) is possible but   creating an organ bank is not. In case of organ transplantation, the process has to   be very quick in order to save a life. Keeping a brain-dead person on ventilator support helps as the organs continue   receiving oxygen, providing a window of time for doctors to conduct organ   transplantation. There is a waiting list of people who have asked for an organ - however, in India, the   waiting list is very huge and the number of organ donors are far lesser. Have you ever imagined how difficult it would be to transport vital organs from one   state to another or even part of a major city to another in the 21st century? Organs    like the heart and lungs give only 4 to 6 hours for the process. The next section will tell you how organs are transported from one state or city to   another. 24  25 "," GREEN CORRIDOR SYSTEM    The green corridor system is one way to expedite organ transplants and save lives.

The concept of consent has been explicitly defined by the Transplantation Of Human Organs Act,  1994. In case of the donation for an unclaimed body/a person dying without any relatives, the  VERIFICATION OF DEATH   consent for organ donation can be given by a person-in-charge of the management of the hospital,   after 48 hours of a person being declared as brain-dead.  The very first step is to verify whether the person is brain-dead and there is no scope for revival. Only  the organs of brain-dead patients' are donated.

The Act received the assent of the President on 8th July, 1994 with an objective to provide for the  ‘regulation of removal, storage and transplantation of human organs for therapeutic purposes and  for the prevention of commercial dealings in human organs and for matters connected therewith or  incidental thereto’.  The matters related to health fall on the State List in India, so every state in India has to adopt this  Act by passing a resolution.  Let’s better understand the law pertaining to organ donation in India, in layman’s terms.   A person is capable of giving consent to organ donation only if he/she is above 18 years of age. If  he/she is a minor, guardians or parents can consent to donating their organs.    The buying and selling of organs are prohibited under the law. If one is convicted of the offence, one  can be sent to upto 10 years imprisonment and be asked to pay a fine of upto  20lakhs (was 5 years  and  10,000 when the Act commenced). Also, under Section 370 of The Indian Penal Code, a person If the body of a person is to be sent for post-mortem, then organs for the purpose of donation can be  who does forced removal or organs (without consent) is liable to be sentenced to jail for 7-10 years    harvested before the process begins if the organs are in no way related to the reason for the  and a fine. post-mortem.

LACK OF PUBLIC-SPIRIT FEAR    Out of the 100% of the Indian population, barely 10% think about the public good and indulge   into causes of public welfare.
